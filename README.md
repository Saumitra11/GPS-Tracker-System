# GPS-Tracker-System
A simple GPS Data Display System that works on the Node-Red Framework. 

Turn the app on before starting your journey and close it once it's over.

Export the json file onto your phone and copy it to your system where node-red is present.

Feed the json to the code and deploy.

Run the timestamp after opening the dashboard and see important data like Average Speed, Time, Distance Traveled and a WorldMap that tracks the path.
